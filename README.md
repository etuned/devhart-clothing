# DevHart Clothing
This project is an Ecommerce website with Stripe intergration, built with React. This is highly flexible and can be made to suit any ecommerce application. This is a demo to show my coding abilities. There is a live demo is available below:

note: I have recently updated this to use typescript, and converted to modern react hooks (see the 'refactor' branch for the updates). Once my refactor is complete, I'll deploy the new version to main. Originally this was built in 2019 when Redux and React had different design patterns. Check the branch 'v2019' to see the older version.
