# DevHart Clothing 
This project is an Ecommerce website with Stripe intergration, built with React, styled with Syled Components, and state is managed with Redux. I have used Typescript to have type safety. The backend is using Firebase. This is highly flexible and can be made to suit any ecommerce application. This is a demo to show my coding abilities. There is a live demo is available below:

note: I have recently updated this to use typescript, and converted to modern react hooks. Originally this was built in 2019 when Redux and React had different design patterns check the branch 'v2019' to see older version.
